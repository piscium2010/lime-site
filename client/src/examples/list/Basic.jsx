    `Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,`,
    `And sorry I could not travel both`,
    `And be one traveler, long I stood`,
    `And looked down one as far as I could`,
    `To where it bent in the undergrowth;`,
    ``,
    `Then took the other, as just as fair,`,
    `And having perhaps the better claim,`,
    `Because it was grassy and wanted wear;`,
    `Though as for that the passing there`,
    `Had worn them really about the same,`,
    ``,
    `And both that morning equally lay`,
    `In leaves no step had trodden black.`,
    `Oh, I kept the first for another day!`,
    `Yet knowing how way leads on to way,`,
    `I doubted if I should ever come back.`,
    ``,
    `I shall be telling this with a sigh`,
    `Somewhere ages and ages hence:`,
    `Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”`,
    `I took the one less traveled by,`,
    `And that has made all the difference.`,
